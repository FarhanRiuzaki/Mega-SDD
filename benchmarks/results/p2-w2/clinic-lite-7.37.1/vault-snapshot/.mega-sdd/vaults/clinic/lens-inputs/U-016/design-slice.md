## Design system (UI-bearing unit — per context-enrichment.md §Design slice)


Design system: style=clinical, trustworthy, anti-generic — brand color on high-signal elements only · palette=primary teal-700 #0E7490 (white foreground, 5.36:1); accent/success green-700 #15803D (5.02:1); raw #0891B2 / #16A34A only for fills, charts and icon accents · typography=humanist sans body with a real type scale; optional serif display headers · a11y=WCAG 2.2 AA — source: vault.json design_system (provenance excluded, audit-only)
UX floor: (ux-rules.md — Accessibility/Forms/Feedback rows, Severity: High)
  - Accessibility/Color Contrast: DO Minimum 4.5:1 ratio for normal text; DON'T Low contrast text [High]
  - Accessibility/Color Only: DO Use icons/text in addition to color; DON'T Red/green only for error/success [High]
  - Accessibility/Alt Text: DO Descriptive alt text for meaningful images; DON'T Empty or missing alt attributes [High]
  - Accessibility/ARIA Labels: DO Add aria-label for icon-only buttons; DON'T Icon buttons without labels [High]
  - Accessibility/Keyboard Navigation: DO Tab order matches visual order; DON'T Keyboard traps or illogical tab order [High]
  - Accessibility/Form Labels: DO Use label with for attribute or wrap input; DON'T Placeholder-only inputs [High]
  - Accessibility/Error Messages: DO Use aria-live or role=alert for errors; DON'T Visual-only error indication [High]
  - Forms/Input Labels: DO Always show label above or beside input; DON'T Placeholder as only label [High]
  - Forms/Submit Feedback: DO Show loading then success/error state; DON'T No feedback after submit [High]
  - Feedback/Loading Indicators: DO Show spinner/skeleton for operations > 300ms; DON'T No feedback during loading [High]
  - Accessibility/Motion Sensitivity: DO Respect prefers-reduced-motion; DON'T Force scroll effects [High]
Modern baseline (non-negotiables — the FLOOR):
  - Design tokens first.
  - Spacing system, not ad-hoc gaps.
  - Typographic scale.
  - Layout is composed, not stacked.
  - Interactive states exist.
  - Feedback states exist.
  - Forms are designed.
  - Accessibility floor = WCAG AA
  - Tables are for data — styled.
  - Distinctive, not generic.
Ceiling moves (clear the floor, then DO these — a floor-only view is "basic/generic"):
  - Page furniture.
  - Composition, not a lone card.
  - Iconography.
  - Visual hierarchy with depth.
  - A signature.
  - Motion with purpose.
  - Density that fits the product.
Anti-kuno tells (a match in your output = defect):
- Unstyled default browser controls / default link blue / default focus-less buttons.
- Layout via nested `<table>` or `<br>` stacks; no page shell (content hugging the left edge full-width).
- No spacing system: arbitrary `margin: 3px 7px 11px`, cramped forms.
- System-default typography wall (no scale, no pairing, line-height 1).
- Raw `<input>` rows with placeholder-as-label, no validation states.
- Native `alert()`/`confirm()`; raw URL text as actions ("click here").
- Unformatted data: ISO timestamps shown raw, unformatted money, raw FK ids.
- Zero hover/focus/disabled treatment; zero loading/empty/error states.
- Inline `style=` attributes everywhere instead of the token layer.
